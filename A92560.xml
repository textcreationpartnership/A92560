            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>EIGHT ARTICLES OF THE Scots Demands.</head>
            <p n="1">IT is desired that it may be entred in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Parliament that no Scotish men, Scotish ships, or Vessels, or passengers belonging to the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> be pressed by land or sea, in any part of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland;</hi> Sea-ports or harbours thereof, seeing these are free of any presse by the Law and practice of our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For a better comerce and intercourse betwixt the Kingdomes of <hi>Scotland, England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that it may be now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd lawfull to transport all goods and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or from thence to <hi>Scotland</hi> in the same case, and as free from customes and all other Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations whatsoever, as if they were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from one part of <hi>Scotland</hi> to another, or from one part or Port of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> to another with these declarations alwayes, that the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156925:3"/>said mutual liberty in so much as concerns goods prohibited by the Lawes of either of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes to be transported to forraigne Nations, shall onely serve for the inward use of the said three Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>Alenially and the manner of the restraint and punishment of the contraveners to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon.</p>
            <p>And that all Natives and forraigne commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties not prohibited in the Kingdomes from whence they transported by the Scotish men as freely as by any of his Majesties subjects of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> and so reciprocally in <hi>Scotland</hi> by the English and Irish.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Scotish shippes comming from forraigne places, and arriving in any Roads, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, or Ports of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> through tempests of weather, or for refreshment, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatsoever other occasions and not disclosed, may be free to passe and repasse without search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or any other impediment, and that if Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish men shall be leaden with moneys or whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever forraigne Commodities in any forraigne part, or in any forraigne Bottome, or in any English or Irish Bortome; That it shall be free to the Owners thereof and their Factors to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load their moneys, goods, and commodities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, at any port of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to transport the same from thence to <hi>Scotland</hi> without any impediment, to be made to them,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156925:3"/>and the English and Irish to have the like liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reciprocally in Scotland.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If any Scotish shippes or any other vessels loaden with Scotish mens goods, going or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from any forraigne Nation pertaining to Scotish men, as aforesaid, shall arrive in any part of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> and having necessity to sell a parcell of their said goods, that it shall be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them to doe the same, and to transport the remnant to <hi>Scotland,</hi> or elsewhere, without payment of any Custome, but for so much as they shall happen to sell, and the English and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish to have the like liberty reciprocally in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. In respect of the great detriment sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Majesties subjects, and by the <hi>Dunkirks</hi> and other Pirats, by robbing them of their goods, taking the shippes and spoyling their men: That some solid course may be taken for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the like in time to come; so that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties subjects may have free trade hereafter, and the Scotish shippes passing to <hi>France, Holland,</hi> or any other part, may have a safe convoy of his Majesties shippes, as the English and Irish ships have.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There can be no greater marke of mutuall unity betwixt the Kingdomes, then a free and peaceable conversing at home and abroad, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we crave from the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> that where the English have any out trade or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156925:4"/>dealing in forraigne places, that it may be free to Scotish men to out-trade and deale in the same places, without any impediment to be made to them by the English or Irish, and the English and Irish to have the like liberty in out trade or dealing of Scottishmen in forraigne places.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That the Scots men be not debarred from being associated in companies within the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> upon such condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as the English and Irish are admitted, and this to be reciprocally for <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> in companies, and all associations in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and because there is not such manufactories as yet ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in <hi>Scotland</hi> as are necessary, and that the trade of fishing (which is is one of the greatest benefits in his Majesties Dominions) is not yet brought to perfection, it is fit that by mutuall concourse of both Kingdomes such a course may be taken, as may best bring the trade of manufactories, in <hi>Scotland</hi> and fishing within his Majesties seas to perfection, and that Commissioners may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the King and Parliaments of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes to treat upon such meanes and conditions as may subsist with the freedome and liberties, and may conduce best to the good and benefit of his Majesties Dominions.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That the House of Parliament would be pleased to take into their considerations the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant customes and texations and other rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous dealings, whereof the particulars are set
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156925:4"/>downe in a note herewith, given in, taken and used by the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> both of the Scottish and English, and whereas his Majesties subjects have already felt the smart thereof, that now some good course may be taken for reducing the said exactions to some reasonable knowne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant measure, and for the liberty of his Majesties subjects from the like rigorous dealing in time to come.</p>
